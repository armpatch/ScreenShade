ScreenShade is an app that draws over other apps in order to cover content on your screen, keeping
the display on while appearing off.

To enable the overlay, single tap the floating button, which can also be dragged around the screen.
Once the overlay is shown, double tap the screen or hit the back button to reveal the screen again.
The floating button can be removed by dragging it to the bottom of the screen.

## Getting Started

The app is available for free on the play store. The source can also be downloaded from here and installed straight onto any device.

### Prerequisites

The minimum Android SDK version is currently 23.
