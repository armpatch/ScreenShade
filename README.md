ScreenShade is an app that uses overlays to cover content on your screen while keeping on the display. 

It was designed to work
with other apps like youtube, where the user may want to listen to the content playing in the video without the video being displayed.
This could be useful if the user was listening to content at work or on public transportation, where they may not want other people to see
the video that they are watching.

The app has gone through multiple iterations, currently the controls are a floating button which can be tapped to enable the overlay.
It can also be dragged around the screen, or dragged to the bottom of the screen to be removed.
